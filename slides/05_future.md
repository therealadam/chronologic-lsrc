# The future

- Fix up README
- Add protocol docs
- Add API docs
- Put a bow on it
- Release it
- Use the crap out of it at Gowalla
- Write adapters for other databases (MySQL, Redis, MongoDB, etc.)

- Sexyback, replace Redis with Cassandra for great win
- Become the John Nunemaker of Cassandra
- More distributed databases, fewer replicated/sharded databases
